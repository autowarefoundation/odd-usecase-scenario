# Feature: Automatic emergency brake trigger against preceding standstill obstacle

This feature ensures that the ADS is able to prevent collisions when static obstacles are detected on Ego's lane sufficiently ahead of time.

## Scenario Outline: Standing pedestrian on flat, straight road

Confirm that vehicle avoids a collision when a pedestrian is stopped on the road.

* Given Ego drives at <vxi_ego>, centered on its lane
* And Pedestrian0 is standing still on the same lane as Ego, at a distance of <dxi_ego_pedestrian0>

* When Ego gets close to Pedestrian0
* Then Ego starts decelerating to a full stop

* When Pedestrian0 moves completely out of Ego's lane
* Then Ego resumes driving
* And Ego reaches the goal position
* And Ego drives with no collisions at all times
* And Ego keeps its acceleration above <amin_ego> at all times
