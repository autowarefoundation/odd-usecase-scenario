# Feature: Handle cut-in from vehicle starting from roadside

This feature ensures that the ego vehicle can safely handle a vehicle that starts moving from the roadside as the ego approaches.

## Scenario Outline: Roadside vehicle starts moving as ego approaches

Confirm that the vehicle safely handles a vehicle starting from the roadside and cutting in.

* Given Ego is driving at <vxi_ego>
* And Npc0 is stopping side of the road
* When the longitudinal distance between Npc0 and Ego is less than <d_trigger_npc0>
* Then Npc0 starts to follow its trajectory with velocity <vxi_npc0>
* And Ego reaches the destination without collisions
* And Ego does not decelerate at a rate below <amin_ego>
