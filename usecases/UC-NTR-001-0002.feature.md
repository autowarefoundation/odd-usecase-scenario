# Feature: Depart while being overtaken

Defines the vehicle's ability to safely depart while a slower vehicle is overtaking.
This allows for efficient driving by avoiding unnecessary waiting when a safe opportunity exists.

## Scenario Outline: Depart during overtake maneuver

Confirm that the vehicle departs during an overtake maneuver by a slower vehicle.

* Given Ego is in standstill
* And Npc0 is positioned behind Ego, in the same driving lane
* And Npc0 is approaching with relatively low velocity <vxi_npc0>
* When Npc0 starts overtaking Ego from distance <dr>
* Then Ego departs for destination before Npc0's overtake maneuver is over
* And Ego reaches the destination without collision
* And Ego does not decelerate at a rate below <amin_ego> during driving
