# Feature: [Turning right in intersection without traffic lights] Handle oncoming lane vehicle driving straight at intersection

This feature ensures that ego can safely turn right at an intersection while an oncoming vehicle is approaching.

## Scenario Outline: Vehicle from oncoming lane drives straight at the intersection ahead of ego (LHT)

Confirm that ego safely performs a right turn at an intersection with oncoming traffic.

* Given Ego is driving at a constant speed <vxi_ego>
* And Ego is approaching an intersection where it intends to turn right
* And Npc0 is stopped on the oncoming traffic lane, positioned on the opposite side of the intersection from Ego

* When Ego is <d_to_intersection> before the intersection
* And Npc0 starts to drive with acceleration <ax_npc0> and target speed <vx_npc0>
* Then Ego slows down

* When Npc0 clears Ego's path
* Then Ego resumes driving and completes the right turn
* And Ego drives safely with no collisions at all times
* And Ego does not decelerate at a rate below <amin_ego> at all times
