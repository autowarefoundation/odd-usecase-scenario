This feature ensures that the ego vehicle can safely turn right at an intersection while an oncoming vehicle is approaching.

## Scenario Outline: Ego performs a right turn at an intersection with oncoming traffic

Confirm that the vehicle safely performs a right turn at an intersection with oncoming traffic.

* Given Ego is driving through an intersection at <vxi_ego>
* When Ego is turning right
* And Npc0 starts to drive with acceleration <ax_npc0> and target speed <vx_npc0>
* Then Ego reaches the destination without collisions
* And Ego does not decelerate at a rate below <amin_ego>
* And Ego stops more than one times in the intersection
