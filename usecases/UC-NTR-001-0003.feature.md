# Feature: Wait for an overtake from same direction lane while stationary

Ensures the vehicle's safety when another car overtakes it at high speed while stationary.
The vehicle waits until the high-speed overtake maneuver is complete before departing.

## Scenario Outline: Overtake from left or right side

Confirm that the vehicle waits for a high-speed overtake in the same direction lane to complete before departing.

* Given Ego is in standstill
* And Npc0 is positioned behind Ego, in the same driving lane
* And Npc0 is driving at <vxi_npc0> towards Ego
* When Npc0 reaches a position at distance <dr> behind Ego
* And Npc0 starts overtaking Ego by using the same direction lane
* Then Ego remains standstill
* When Npc0 reaches position <df> ahead of Ego
* And Npc0 finishes the overtake maneuver
* Then Ego starts driving
* And Ego reaches the destination without collision
* And Ego does not decelerate at a rate below <amin_ego> during driving

### Examples: Npc overtakes through left lane

  | vxi_npc0 | dr    | df    | overtake_offset | w     | amin_ego   |
  | -------- | ----- | ----- | --------------- | ----- | ---------- |
  | 20 km/h  | 7.0 m | 5.0 m | 2.5 m           | 3.0 m | -1.5 m/s^2 |
  | 30 km/h  | 7.0 m | 5.0 m | 2.5 m           | 3.0 m | -1.5 m/s^2 |
  | 40 km/h  | 7.0 m | 5.0 m | 2.5 m           | 3.0 m | -1.5 m/s^2 |
  
### Examples: Right side overtake

  | vxi_npc0 | dr    | df    | overtake_offset | w     | amin_ego   |
  | -------- | ----- | ----- | --------------- | ----- | ---------- |
  | 20 km/h  | 7.0 m | 5.0 m | -2.5 m          | 3.0 m | -1.5 m/s^2 |
