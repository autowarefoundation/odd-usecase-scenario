# Feature: Handle cut-in from a faster vehicle that then slows down

This feature ensures that the ego vehicle can safely handle a cut-in from another vehicle that is moving at a higher speed and then decelerates.

## Scenario Outline: Cut-in from a faster vehicle that decelerates after lane change

Confirm that the vehicle safely handles a cut-in from a faster vehicle that then decelerates.

* Given Ego is driving at <vxi_ego>
* And Npc0 is in a neighbor lane behind Ego, driving at <vxi_npc0>
* When Npc0 overtakes Ego and performs a lane change to cut in front of Ego at a distance of <d_lc_npc0>
* And Npc0 decelerates to <vx_target_slow_npc0> with acceleration <a_slow_npc0>
* Then Ego reaches the destination without collision
* And Ego does not decelerate at a rate below <amin_ego>
* And Ego velocity does not fall below 80% of <vxi_slow_npc0> after Npc0 slows down
