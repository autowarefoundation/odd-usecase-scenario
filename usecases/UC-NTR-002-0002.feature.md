* Given Ego is driving at <vxi_ego>
* And Npc0 is parked on one side of the same lane
* And Npc1 is parked on the other side of the same lane, <d_npc0_npc1> ahead of Npc0

* When Ego approaches the parked vehicles
* Then Ego navigates between Npc0 and Npc1
* And Ego reaches the destination
* And Ego drives safely with no collisions at all times
* And Ego does not decelerate at a rate below <amin_ego> at all times
