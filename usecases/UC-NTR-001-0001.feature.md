Confirm that the vehicle waits for a complete overtake before departing.

* Given Ego is in standstill
* And Npc0 is positioned behind Ego, in the same driving lane
* And Npc0 is driving at <vxi_npc0> towards Ego
* When Npc0 reaches a position at distance <dr> behind Ego
* And Npc0 starts overtaking Ego
* Then Ego remains standstill
* When Npc0 reaches a position <df> ahead of Ego
* And Npc0 finishes the overtake maneuver
