# Feature: Maintain safe distance from hidden motorcycle slowing down

Ensures that ego is able to keep a safe distance from a slowing motorcycle that is initially obstructed from ego's perception by another preceding motorcycle. This is required to provide ego with the ability to quickly react to objects detected suddenly.

## Scenario Outline: Maintain safe distance from hidden motorcycle slowing down when preceding motorcycle cuts out to the left

Confirm that ego is able to adjust its speed such as to maintain a safe distance from a decelerating motorcycle that is initially hidden by a preceding motorcycle, when the preceding motorcycle cuts out from ego lane to the left.

* Given Ego is driving at <vxi_ego>
* And Npc0 is positioned ahead of ego, in the same lane
* And Npc0 is driving at a speed <vxi_npc0>, slower than ego
* And Motorbike0 is positioned <dxi_npc0_motorbike0> ahead of Npc0, in the same lane
* And Motorbike0 is driving at the same speed as Npc0, <vxi_npc0>

* When Ego approaches Npc0 longitudinally, to within <dx_ego_npc0>
* And later Npc0 cuts out from the ego lane to the left, within a time span of <time_cut_in_npc0>
* And Motorbike0 decelerates down to <vx_motorbike1> at a rate of <ax_motorbike0>
* Then Ego starts decelerating to match the speed of Motorbike0, <vx_motorbike1>
* And Ego drives continuously at all times
* And Ego keeps its deceleration rate slower than <axmin_ego> at all times
* And Ego drives safely with no collisions at all times
