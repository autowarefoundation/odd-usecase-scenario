# Feature: Lane keeping 

Ensures that ego is able to drive in the center of the lane under different conditions. This is required to prevent ego from sticking out to neighboring lanes or exiting the road unintentionally.

## Scenario Outline: Lane keeping on narrowing lane

Confirm that ego is able to continue driving on the center of the lane when the width of the lane becomes narrower.

* Given a lane with width <initial_lane_width>
* And Ego is driving on the lane at a velocity <vxi_ego>

* When Ego approaches a new lane section with width <lane_width>, smaller than <initial_lane_width>
* Then Ego adjusts its lateral position as required to drive in the center of the new lane section
* And Ego drives continuously at all times
* And Ego drives within <d_lane_center_offset> from the lane center at all times
