# Feature: Maintain driving speed according to regulation

Ensures that ego is able to limit its driving speed based on the road regulations. This is required for ego to follow the law.

## Scenario Outline: Update driving speed when a entering a lower speed limit section

Confirm that ego is able to adjust its speed before entering the new regulation area and avoid law infringements.

* Given a road section with speed limit <vxi_limit>
* And Ego is driving at a velocity <vxi_ego>, smaller or equal to <vxi_limit>

* When Ego approaches a road area with new speed limitation <vx_limit>, below the current ego speed
* Then Ego starts decelerating to match the new speed limit <vx_limit>
* And Ego drives continuously at all times
* And Ego keeps its deceleration rate slower than <axmin_ego> at all times

### Examples:

  | vxi_ego  | vxi_limit | vx_limit | axmin_ego  |
  | -------- | --------- | -------- | ---------- |
  | 70 km/h  | 70 km/h   | 60 km/h  | -1.5 m/s^2 |
  | 90 km/h  | 100 km/h  | 80 km/h  | -1.5 m/s^2 |
  | 100 km/h | 110 km/h  | 80 km/h  | -1.5 m/s^2 |


## Scenario Outline: Update driving speed when a entering a higher speed limit section

Confirm that ego is able to adjust its speed when entering the new regulation area

* Given a road section with speed limit <vxi_limit>
* And Ego is driving at a velocity restricted to <vxi_limit>

* When Ego approaches a road area with new speed limitation <vx_limit>, higher than the current one
* Then Ego starts accelerating to match the lowest value between the new speed limit <vx_limit> and Ego's intended driving speed <vx_ego>
* And Ego drives continuously at all times

### Examples:

  | vx_ego   | vxi_limit | vx_limit |
  | -------- | --------- | -------- |
  | 90 km/h  | 70 km/h   | 80 km/h  |
  | 110 km/h | 80 km/h   | 120 km/h |
  | 120 km/h | 110 km/h  | 120 km/h |
