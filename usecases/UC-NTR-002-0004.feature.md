# Feature: Wait for overtaking vehicle to clear off the ego lane

Ensures the vehicle can safely wait for an oncoming vehicle to clear from the ego lane before proceeding.

## Scenario Outline: Overtake the vehicle which comes from opposite side

Confirm that the vehicle successfully waits until the overtaking vehicle has left the lane when overtaking a parked vehicle from the opposite side.

* Given Ego is driving at <vxi_ego>
* And Npc0 is parked in the opposite side of the road
* And Npc1 is driving in the opposite lane
* When the longitudinal distance between Npc0 and Ego is below <d_trigger>
* And Npc1 starts to overtake Npc0 with velocity <vx_npc1>
* Then Ego begins decelerating before Npc1 approaches within <d_dec> behind Npc0
* And Ego waits for Npc1 to clear from the ego lane
* And Ego reaches the destination without collision
* And Ego does not decelerate at a rate below <amin_ego> during driving
