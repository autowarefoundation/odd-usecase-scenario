# Feature: Longitudinal velocity control

This feature ensures that the ADS is able to adjust its speed such as to keep a safe longitudinal distance from preceding moving vehicles.

## Scenario Outline: Preceding vehicle partial deceleration on flat, straight road

Confirm that the ADS is capable of keeping a safe distance from a preceding vehicle that decelerates partially.

* Given Ego drives at <vxi_ego>, centered on its lane
* And Npc0 drives on the same lane as Ego, 30 meters ahead of it
* And Npc0 drives slower than Ego, at a speed of <vxi_npc0>

* When Ego gets close to Npc0
* Then Ego starts decelerating
* And Ego matches Npc0's longitudinal speed

* When Npc0 starts decelerating to <vx_target_npc0> with a rate of <ax_npc0>
* Then Ego starts decelerating further
* And Ego matches Npc0's longitudinal speed
* And Ego reaches the goal position
* And Ego drives continuously (no full stops) at all times
* And Ego drives with no collisions at all times
* And Ego keeps its acceleration above <amin_ego> at all times
