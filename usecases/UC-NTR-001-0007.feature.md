# Feature: Handle cut-in from a faster vehicle

This feature ensures that the ego vehicle can safely handle a cut-in from another vehicle that is moving at a higher speed.

## Scenario Outline: Cut-in from outside of the lane

Confirm that the ego vehicle does not slow down when a faster vehicle cuts in.

* Given Ego is driving at <vxi_ego>
* And Npc0 is in a neighbor lane behind Ego, driving at <vxi_npc0>
* When Npc0 overtakes Ego with <vxi_npc0> which is greater than <vxi_ego>
* And Npc0 performs a lane change to cut in front of Ego at a distance of <d_lc_npc0> from Ego
* Then Ego reaches the destination without collision
* And Ego does not decelerate at a rate below <amin_ego> after Npc0 changed lane
