# Feature: Handle cut-in from vehicle at intersection

This feature ensures that the ego vehicle can safely handle a vehicle that cuts into the ego's path at an intersection.

## Scenario Outline: Vehicle from right performs a right turn at an intersection

Confirm that the vehicle safely handles a vehicle from the right performing a right turn at an intersection.

* Given Ego is driving at a constant velocity <vxi_ego>
* And Npc0 is positioned to the right and intends to turn right
* When Ego is <d_to_intersection> before the intersection, Npc0 starts turning right with a very small velocity <vx_npc0>
* Then Ego reaches the destination without collisions
* And Ego does not decelerate at a rate below <amin_ego>

### Examples

| vxi_ego | d_to_intersection | vx_npc0 | amin_ego   |
| ------- | ----------------- | ------- | ---------- |
| 50 km/h | 40 m              | 5 km/h  | -3.0 m/s^2 |
| 40 km/h | 30 m              | 5 km/h  | -2.5 m/s^2 |
