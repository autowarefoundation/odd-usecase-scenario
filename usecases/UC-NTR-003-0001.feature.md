# Feature: [Driving straight in intersection without traffic lights] Handle cut-in from oncoming lane vehicle turning at the intersection

This feature ensures that ego can safely handle a vehicle that cuts into the ego's path at an intersection.

## Scenario Outline: Vehicle from oncoming lane performs a right turn at the intersection ahead of ego (LHT)

Confirm that ego allows the turning vehicle to pass first before driving through the intersection.

* Given Ego is driving at a constant velocity <vxi_ego>
* And Ego is approaching an intersection
* And Npc0 is on the oncoming traffic lane, positioned on the opposite side of the intersection from ego

* When Ego is <d_to_intersection> before the intersection
* And Npc0 starts turning right into the intersection with speed <vx_npc0>
* Then Ego slows down

* When Npc0 clears Ego's path
* Then Ego resumes driving and drives past the intersection
* And Ego drives safely with no collisions at all times
* And Ego does not decelerate at a rate below <amin_ego>
