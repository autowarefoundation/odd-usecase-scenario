Confirm that ego successfully overtakes the vehicle and reaches the destination safely.

* Given Ego is driving at <vxi_ego>
* And Npc0 is positioned on the side of the same lane
* And Npc0 is driving in the same direction as Ego with velocity <vxi_npc0>

* When Ego approaches Npc0
* Then Ego overtake Npc0
* And Ego reaches the destination
* And Ego drives safely with no collisions at all times
* And Ego does not decelerate at a rate below <amin_ego> at all times
