# Feature: [Driving straight in intersection without traffic lights] Yielding decision for slow oncoming lane vehicle turning at intersection

This feature ensures that the ego vehicle makes a safe decision to either stop or proceed driving straight at an intersection when there is an oncoming vehicle slowly turning into its path.

## Scenario Outline: Ego decides to whether to yield for slow oncoming vehicle turning right at the intersection (LHT)

Confirm that the vehicle safely decides whether to stop or pass when a slow-moving NPC turns right and interferes with its trajectory in an intersection.

* Given Ego is driving at a constant velocity <vxi_ego>
* And Ego is approaching an intersection
* And Npc0 is on the oncoming traffic lane, positioned on the opposite side of the intersection from ego

* When Ego is <d_to_intersection> before the intersection
* And Npc0 starts turning right into the intersection with speed <vx_npc0>
* Then Ego slows down or continues driving straight
* And Ego drives past the intersection
* And Ego drives safely with no collisions at all times
* And Ego does not decelerate at a rate below <amin_ego> at all times
