# Feature: Decide to stop or pass for slow oncoming vehicle at intersection

This feature ensures that the ego vehicle makes a safe decision to either stop or proceed through an intersection when an oncoming vehicle is moving slowly.

## Scenario Outline: Ego decides to stop or pass for a slow oncoming vehicle

Confirm that the vehicle safely decides whether to stop or pass when a slow-moving NPC interferes with its trajectory in an intersection.

* Given Ego is driving through an intersection at <vxi_ego>
* And Npc0 is positioned to the opposite lane and intends to turn right
* When Ego is <d_to_intersection> before the intersection
* And Npc0 starts turning right with a very small velocity <vx_npc0>
* Then Ego reaches the destination without collisions
* And Ego does not decelerate at a rate below <amin_ego>
