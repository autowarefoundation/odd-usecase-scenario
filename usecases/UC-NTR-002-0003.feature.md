# Feature: Overtake the moving vehicles in side of the road

Ensures the vehicle can safely navigate when a parked vehicle starts moving while Ego is approaching another parked vehicle.

## Scenario Outline: Vehicle is stopped on roadside while another vehicle starts moving from the opposite side

Confirm that the vehicle successfully makes a decision to either overtake or wait when encountering a parked vehicle and an oncoming vehicle that starts moving.

* Given Ego is driving at <vx_ego>
* And Npc0 is parked on one side of the road
* And Npc1 is initially stationary on the other side of the road
* When the longitudinal distance between Ego and Npc0 is below <d_trigger>
* And Npc1 starts to drive with velocity <vx_npc1>
* Then Ego makes a decision to overtake Npc0 or wait for Npc1
* And Ego overtakes Npc0 or waits for Npc1 in proper place before overtaking
* And Ego reaches the destination without collision
* And Ego does not decelerate at a rate below <amin_ego> during driving
