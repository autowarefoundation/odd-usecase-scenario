# Feature: Overtake the stopped or slow-moving vehicles in side of the road with oncoming traffic

Ensures that Ego can safely overtake a parked vehicle, or a slow-moving vehicle in the presence of oncoming traffic on the same lane.

## Scenario Outline: Overtake stopped vehicle on roadside while an oncoming vehicle starts moving

Confirm that the vehicle successfully makes a decision to either overtake or wait when encountering a parked vehicle and an oncoming vehicle that starts moving.

* Given Ego is driving at <vxi_ego>
* And Npc0 is parked on one side of the same lane
* And Npc1 is parked on the other side of the same lane, <d_npc0_npc1> ahead of Npc1
* And Npc1 is facing the opposite direction from Ego

* When the longitudinal distance between Ego and Npc0 is below <d_trigger>
* And Npc1 starts to drive with velocity <vx_npc1>
* Then Ego starts overtaking Npc0 or waits for Npc1 to pass
* And Ego overtakes Npc0
* And Ego reaches the destination
* And Ego drives safely with no collision at all times
* And Ego does not decelerate at a rate below <amin_ego> at all times
